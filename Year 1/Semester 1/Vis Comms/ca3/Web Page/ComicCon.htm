It was founded as the "Golden State Comic Book Convention" in 1970 by a group of San Diegans, which included Shel Dorf, Richard Alf, Ken Krueger and Mike Towry; later, it was called the "San Diego Comic Book Convention". The name, as given on its website, is Comic-Con International: San Diego; but it is commonly known as Comic-Con or the San Diego Comic-Con or "SDCC".[2][3][4][5] It is a four-day event (Thursday-Sunday) held during the summer in San Diego, in southern California, United States. On Wednesday evening, there is a preview for professionals, exhibitors, and some guests pre-registered for all four days.
 
Comic-Con International also produces two other conventions, WonderCon and the Alternative Press Expo (APE), both held in San Francisco, in northern California. Since 1974, Comic-Con has bestowed its annual Inkpot Award on guests and persons of interest in the Popular Arts industries, as well as on members of Comic-Con's Board of Directors and the Convention Committee. It is also the home of the Will Eisner Awards.
 
Originally showcasing comic books, science fiction/fantasy and film/television, and related popular arts, the convention now includes a larger range of pop culture elements, such as horror, animation, anime, manga, toys, collectible card games, video games, webcomics, and fantasy novels. The convention is the largest of its kind in the Americas and the fourth largest in the world after the Comiket in Japan, the Angoulême International Comics Festival in France,[6][7][8] and the Lucca Comics & Games in Italy.[9] In 2010, it filled the San Diego Convention Center to capacity with over 130,000 attendees.
